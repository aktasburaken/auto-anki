# Auto Anki
Open source Anki (language flash card app) automation bot. You are setting words and meanings for Anki in a text file and bot is writing them down in it.

This bot is working with clicking relevant places on screen instead of you. 
What that means is you should set specific pixel locations for every single click to achieve actions.

## For Someone Who Doesn't Know Anything About Programming

If you have already python on your computer and know something about programming, scroll to the <strong>Everyone</strong> topic.

You should set a specific location for your Anki's adding card page and VS Code on your screen. 

There is config part in the code.

Before learning what are these configurations mean, we need to understand <strong>deck configs'</strong> variables with px (All of them ^^). Because you need to reassign these variables one by one according to your monitor and location of the both apps.

Don't forget that, if you don't want to change all config part of your code every single time before using <strong>Auto Anki</strong>, ensure you are preserving location of the both apps VS Code and Anki.
