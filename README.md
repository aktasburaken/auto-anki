# auto-anki
Open source Anki (language flash card app) automation bot. You are setting words and meanings for Anki and bot is writing them down in it.

## For Someone Who Doesn't Know Anything About Programming

### You should set a specific location for your Anki's adding card page and VS Code.

The reason is this bot is working with clicking some places on screen instead of you. 
What that means is you should set specific pixel locations for every single click to achieve actions.
